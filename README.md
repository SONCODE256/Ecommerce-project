# Ecommerce-project
eCommerce Analytics Project — SQL-based analysis on retail sales data to answer business questions (traffic, bounce rate, revenue, orders) using CTEs, joins, and time filters. Includes clean queries, notes, and reproducible outputs.
## 📌 Project Overview

This repository is an **eCommerce Analytics project using SQL** to analyze performance across the full customer journey — from **traffic acquisition** to **user behavior** and finally **conversion & revenue**.

The project answers **real-world business questions** and produces metrics such as:

- **Visits, pageviews, and transactions** by month  
- **Bounce rate** and **conversion rate** by traffic source  
- **Revenue trends** by week/month, including **cumulative revenue**  
- **Revenue contribution** by device category (desktop, mobile, etc.)  
- **Purchaser vs. non-purchaser behavior** comparisons  
- **Cross-sell insights** (products also purchased together)  
- **Product-level funnel/cohort map**: *view → add_to_cart → purchase*  

The goal is to practice a complete analytics workflow: choosing the right tables/columns, joining data correctly, filtering time periods, calculating KPIs, and writing clean, reproducible SQL.

## 🚀 What You Will Gain

By completing this project, you will gain:

### ✅ Strong SQL Analytics Skills
- Write clean, structured queries using **CTEs**
- Apply correct **date filtering** and time grouping (**weekly / monthly**)
- Calculate key KPI formulas (**rates, ratios, contributions**)
- Build **cumulative metrics** (running totals)

### ✅ End-to-End Funnel & Cohort Thinking
- Measure performance across the funnel: **view → add_to_cart → purchase**
- Compute product-level **add_to_cart_rate** and **purchase_rate**
- Understand user behavior differences (**purchasers vs non-purchasers**)

### ✅ Business Insight & Decision Support
- Identify high-performing **traffic sources** and **devices**
- Evaluate **volume vs. efficiency** (traffic vs conversion)
- Discover cross-sell patterns for recommendation ideas

### ✅ Portfolio-Ready Deliverable
- A well-structured GitHub repo showcasing real eCommerce KPI analysis
- Clear, interview-ready examples: funnel analysis, revenue trends, and segmentation
## 📂 Dataset

This project uses **Google Analytics 360 Sample (Google Merchandise Store)** exported to **BigQuery**.  
The dataset contains **session-level data** with nested structures for **hits**, **eCommerce actions**, and **product details**.

### 🔎 Key Concepts
- **Session-level metrics** are stored in `totals` (visits, pageviews, transactions, bounces, hits).
- **Traffic attribution** comes from `trafficSource.source`.
- **Device segmentation** comes from `device.deviceCategory`.
- **Product & funnel events** (view → add_to_cart → purchase) come from `hits.eCommerceAction` and `hits.product`.
